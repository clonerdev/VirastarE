# TextSummarizer
This is the C# implementation of Automatic TextSummarization and keyword extraction based on TextRank algorithm [1]. The original paper can be found [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf). This project came out as an intiative to improve the open-source library for C# and is inspired by one of the popular TextRank implementations for [Python](https://github.com/davidadamojr/TextRank).
